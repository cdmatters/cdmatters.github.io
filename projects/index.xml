      <description> Smithers is a poker bot server in C++. It allows your bots to play poker against each other very fast. It is written in C++ because when C++ is your hammer, everything is a thumb.

      <description> Twirps is a project to collect, analyse and visualise politician&amp;rsquo;s tweets. A preliminary version was built in the run up to the 2015 UK General Election, and it was later turned into a Flask web app in 2017, using a graph Neo4j database as it&amp;rsquo;s datastore.

      <description>snayk is a game in 400 lines of pure javascript, written during my time at the Recurse Center. It is simply the classic game of snake, adapted to use polar coordinates, instead of Cartesian ones. You can play snayk here.
Background I had just finished my physics degree at Cambridge, and had already spent some time thinking about how different coordinate systems can make problems easier or harder.
While at RC, I attended a seminar run by Mary Rose Cook in game development, in which she laid out the basics of coding up Space Invaders, based on her very popular annotated code blog posts.</description>
