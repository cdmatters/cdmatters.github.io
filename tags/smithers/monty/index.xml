      <description> Monty is a repository of bots that work with the smithers poker bot engine. Currently these bots are quite naive, but the aim is to investigate multi-agent RL in this scenario.
You can watch a very naive game between bots (prerecorded and slowed down to human-viewing speed) here.

      <description>Smithers is a poker bot server in C++. It allows your bots to play poker against each other very fast over a network. It is implemented in C++, partly as an exercise, partly as a learning opportunity in learning a low level stack, and partly because it&amp;rsquo;s fast.
In terms of its structure, Smithers is composed of a configuration for a mongrel2 server (which hooks up the http/websockets requests to ZeroMQ endpoints) and an executable which communicates with those endpoints and effectively runs the game.</description>
